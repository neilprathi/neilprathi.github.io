					<h3>Web and Social Media</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This semester, I worked to re-establish the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/proof.magazine/">[proof] Instagram account</a>, which hadn’t been active since 2018 (besides one post in 2019). With my co-editor, Alison, I cleaned up the account, created a logo, and increased our follower count 1.5x. Once we distribute copies of [proof] in print, we will periodically be posting blurbs of stories in each issue. We also created a [proof] Twitter account (@proofmagazine_) to engage with our audience on other platforms. Additionally, I helped set up the <a href="http://proofmagazine540069515.wordpress.com">[proof] website</a>, which will be used actively next semester for digital publication.</p>

					<h3>Editing and Leadership</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This semester was especially important for me as a leader. Throughout the semester, I focused on producing a magazine that was interesting and unique, with multiple revisions on each article, while still allowing each writers’ own work to shine—for example, on the film photography article (right), I kept to the writer’s flow of ideas, but helped them flesh it out in a more compelling way. One other element we focused on was engaging our audience with our content in a way that was important to them. To this end, we created and released an audience survey (right) with possibilities for the core elements and content of the magazine. We also advertised submitting to the gallery via social media, and received over 150 submissions.</p>

					<h3>Design</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Prior to joining the Incubator, my InDesign experience was limited to one digital issue of [proof] last year. However, this year, I worked to learn InDesign and apply it to create engaging spreads using design techniques. I turned to professional and college arts magazines to learn more about how to create spreads that would attract the audience’s attention. I especially focused on placing and sizing images in visually distinct and interesting ways, and using images and graphics to lead the audience along the article. Since [proof] is an arts magazine, it’s especially important to have appealing spread designs with a consistent image (e.g. typography).</p>

					<h3>Photojournalism</h3>
				</header>
				<p>News photography was an entirely new domain to me this year. One of the biggest challenges was being able to switch contexts between different stories and angles, especially when new information comes to light. For the fire alarm story (right), I initially planned to take large, wide-angle photos of the crowd; after discussing with those working on the article, I realized that it would be more impactful to take close-up photos of administrators and students. Now, I have my camera on me at all times so that I’m ready for any potential stories.</p>
